##Background Story
This project was inspired by the differt causes caused by the lack of water in small places.

  ## My Solution 
     I devised a way to use ML on arduino to solve the problem.
                                                                                                                                                 
    # Let's build it
## Hardware setup
Step 1: Connect Arduino board or fix arduino board to laptop and configure edge impulse.  
                                                                                                                                                 
Step 2: Software Setup
